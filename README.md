idrtools
========

This python package allows for easier interface between a Python Shell and the IDRISI Taiga/Selva software.
This current package is very bare-bones and is considered version 0 because there is much to do concerning its
development.  If you are interested in joining the development team for this package, please create a GitHub 
account and email me at ashatz.hero@gmail.com and I would be happy to add you.

To begin working with this package, first select the Clone to Desktop icon at the bottom right of the screen and
install the GitHub application for windows.  This will allow you to easily access the idrtools_v0 repository and 
clone it to your desktop in the "GitHub" directory within your documents folder.  From there, opent the 'idrtools_v0' 
directory and copy the "idrtools" directory into the "C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages" directory.  This will allow you
to import idrtools directly from the Python Shell.  From there, you are ready to experiment with this package.  Please
report any bugs or concerns via GitHub, and I or any member of the development team will be eager to address the issue.

Thank you very much, and I hope that you find your time using idrtools both convenient and enjoyable.
